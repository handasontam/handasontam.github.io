This month's puzzle is relatively easy. 



$$
\begin{align}
P(\text{A wins at A's turn}) &= 1 - P(\text{A loses at A's turn}) \\
&= 1 - ((1-p) * 1 + p * P(\text{A loses at B's turn}))^2 \\
&= 1 - (1 - p + p * P(\text{A loses at B's turn}))^2 \\
&= 1 - (1 - p + p * (1-P(\text{A wins at B's turn})))^2 \\
&= 1 - (1 - p + p * (1-(p*P(\text{A wins at A's turn}))^2))^2 \\
\end{align}$$

If we let $$P(\text{A wins at A's turn})$$ be $$x$$, we have:

$$
x = 1 - (1 - p + p * (1 - (p * x)^2))^2
$$

Rearranging and simplifying, we have:

$$
x = 2 p^3 x^2 - p^6 x^4
$$

The infimum of the set of all probabilities p for which x > 0 can be solved using algebra sofware.

$$p = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 2^{2/3}} \approx 0.945, \quad x = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.889$$
