In recent years, I've fully embraced the one-bag travel philosophy, often surprising friends with how little I pack for trips. This approach, while not widely adopted in my home city of Hong Kong, has transformed the way I travel. Going "one-bag" eliminates worries about lost luggage, weight restrictions, or struggling with rolling suitcases on cobblestone streets. It's both liberating and cost-effective.

This gear list is inspired by resources like [Mark Verber's annual gear roundup](https://verber.com/gear2024/), the [Gossamer Gear Italy packing list](https://www.gossamergear.com/blogs/our-blog/vagabond-pack-italy), and the wealth of knowledge shared in the Reddit [Ultralight](https://reddit.com/r/Ultralight/) and [OneBag](https://reddit.com/r/onebag/) communities. The items listed here have earned their place as my current favorites. While I haven't tried every alternative, I've conducted extensive research before making purchases and rarely regret my choices. Items in **bold** are standouts that I consider best-in-class.

## On Person

Samsung S21FE (177g / 6.4'): With a 4500mAh battery and IP68 rating, this phone serves me well. I'm considering a switch to iPhone in the future for better integration with my Macbook and iPad, as well as to explore Apple's Intelligence capabilities.

**Montbell Trail Wallet** (15g): This ultralight wallet, crafted from durable 330D Ballistic nylon, fits perfectly in the shoulder strap pocket of my Gossamer Gear pack. It features dedicated spots for coins and keys. Other lightweight options include the [ifyouhave Wallet 2 (14g)](https://ifyouhave.stores.jp/items/5ecca25a34ef01087a46469e) and [Minimalight Play Wallet (15g)](https://minimalight.thebase.in/items/43829761).

Victorinox Classic SD (20g): This compact multitool covers most camp tasks without adding significant weight.

## Bags

**Gossamergear Vagabond Jet (2021 version)** (648g / 22.8oz): This versatile 23L pack is my go-to for everyday carry, one-bag travel, and even day hikes when I don't need my full hiking setup. The laptop compartment is suspended 3 inches from the bottom, providing excellent protection against shocks. After three years of use, it remains in good condition, with only minor stitching issues on the laptop suspension (easily repaired by flipping the bag inside out and sewn back the laptop suspension). The sewn-in shoulder strap pocket is a standout feature, offering convenient storage for a wallet and phone without compromising the bag's sleek appearance. While some may worry about the top opening collecting rain or debris, I haven't encountered any issues. The only drawback for me is the slightly long torso length. Overall, it strikes an excellent balance between comfort, organization, and weight. Other solid options include the [Minimalight ordinary Pac (358g)](https://minimalight.thebase.in/items/85137709) and [Volpi Falco (480g)](https://www.volpioutdoorgear.com/product-page/falco-1).

[**Decathlon QUECHUA FH900 19L**](https://www.decathlon.com.hk/p/%E6%A5%B5%E9%80%9F%E5%81%A5%E8%A1%8C%E8%83%8C%E5%8C%85fh900-14%E5%88%B019-l%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%B9%E9%87%8F-quechua-8503969.html) (14-19L adjustable): An incredibly versatile and affordable daypack. The roll-top design allows you to adjust the volume, and it even has a side zipper for easy access. While it comes with a 2L water bladder, I prefer using the bladder pocket to store a foam seat pad (e.g. the [Decathlon Trekking Foam Seat](https://www.decathlon.com.hk/en-HK/p/trekking-camping-foam-seat-trek-pad-grey-orange-forclaz-8493400.html)) for extra comfort. The back pocket, designed for the water bladder, can also accommodate a 13" Macbook (without a sleeve) in a pinch, though caution is advised due to the lack of padding and open top. The mesh side pocket is suitable for small items like a hat but doesn't secure water bottles effectively.

## Electronics

Macbook Pro 13" 2018 (1.37kg): With 16GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. While still functional, I'm considering an upgrade to a Macbook Air with 32GB RAM for improved performance in web browsing, coding, and paper writing. Compute-intensive tasks are offloaded to a Linux server.

iPad Pro 12.9" 4th generation: Primarily used for note-taking via GoodNotes.

Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds: Excellent sound quality and noise cancellation in a compact package, perfect for drowning out airplane noise or working in noisy environments.

Nitecore NB10000 Power Bank (150g / 5.29oz): A reliable, lightweight 10,000mAh battery capable of fast-charging most devices. Essential for multi-day trips or heavy phone use while traveling. For more options, check out the [Batteries Datasheet from ultralightdandy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-AL_bU5yGwcGXiqpIQ8qeoi4_XGkkug8HGxDbnnkkQc/edit?gid=1623186548#gid=1623186548).

Nitecore NU20 Headlamp (with shock cord mod, 33g): A simple, lightweight headlamp with a single-button interface. The shock cord mod improves comfort and reduces weight.

## Clothing

This section highlights standout clothing items that I highly recommend. I also wear other basic t-shirts and pants not listed here.

[Sunday Afternoon Sun Guide Cap](https://www.sundayafternoons.com/products/sun-guide-cap) (93g): Excellent sun protection. The [Parapack P-cap (28g)](https://www.parapack.co/shopheadwear/p/p-cap) is a lighter, more packable alternative. The [Montbell Rain Umbrero](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=1128716) is another intriguing option I've seen on the trails.

Zenni Glasses with XTRActive Polarized 1.53: Ordering glasses online from Zenni offers significant savings compared to local opticians. Simply input your prescription and choose your lens type. Note that these lenses may appear slightly gray even indoors. For those in Hong Kong needing a prescription, consider the affordable "Comprehensive Eye Examination" at [PolyU](https://ocwb.polyu.edu.hk/OptometryClinicWebBooking/).

**Patagonia Capilene Cool Lightweight Shirt** (74g): My go-to base layer for hot and humid conditions. It excels at wicking sweat and dries quickly, making it perfect for Hong Kong's sweltering summers. For more options, check out this [Summer Wear DataSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pA8ym5gRNhmfyDUdBcTGv14gtyV25XMLpdrpZb0mdxY/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by DeputySean.

[Uniqlo Dry-ex lightweight tee shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com.hk/en_GB/product-detail.html?productCode=u0000000050296): An affordable alternative to the Patagonia Capilene Cool Lightweight Shirt, though not quite as breathable.

[**Yamatomichi UL Shirt**](https://www.yamatomichi.com/en/products/ul-shirt) (91g): Made from 100% ShadowRip Polyester, this ultralight, highly breathable button-up offers excellent sun protection and can double as a wind shirt. These are hard to find outside of Japan unless pre-ordered.

**Ministry of Supply Hybrid Short Sleeve Seersucker** (Size S, Light Grey): Exceptionally comfortable and breathable for hot weather.

**Cumulus Primelite Pullover** (180g): An incredibly light and warm down jacket that packs tiny, providing an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio for cool evenings or mountain trips. For alternatives, check out this excellent [Down Jacket indicator datasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ceVWWwGTdc1KcTkIQFWscILPtA2pbgpq0UQQIq1D6gE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) created by ormagon_89 in the Reddit Ultralight community.

**Mountain Hardwear AirMesh Hoodie** (140g): This active insulation piece is a game-changer for high-output activities in cool weather. The mesh side absorbs moisture while the fleece side (made with Teijin Octa fabric) provides warmth. Paired with a wind shirt, it's all I need for most Hong Kong winters. For more insights, check out this [discussion](https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/airmesh-teijin-octa-fabric-is-the-most-versatile-fabric-i-have-ever-field-tested/). Alternatives include [Farpointe Alpha Cruiser](https://www.farpointeog.com/commerce/redirect?productId=6098752f744ed54a8fdebc58&utm_source=customer_notification&utm_medium=email), [Senchi Designs Alpha Hoodie](https://senchidesigns.com/), and [Macpac Nitro Fleece Pullover](https://www.macpac.co.nz/macpac-mens-nitro-fleece-pullover/115606.html).

**CAYL Light Air Jacket** (98.2g): Made from 12D Pertex Quantum Air fabric (the same as the Mountain Hardwear Kor Airshell), this jacket offers excellent breathability and weather resistance. Its double zipper and armpit vents provide versatile ventilation options rarely found in other wind shirts. Combined with the Mountain Hardwear AirMesh Hoodie, it can handle most Hong Kong winters.

Montbell Versalite Rain Jacket (182g): A fully-featured ultralight rain jacket with pit zips for ventilation. It's proven reliably waterproof through numerous downpours. While not necessary for short hikes in Hong Kong, it's useful for camping in cold rain or adding extra warmth when combined with the AirMesh/Polartec Alpha Hoodie.

[**Mountain Hardwear Trail Sender Pant**](https://www.mountainhardwear.com/p/mens-trail-sender-pant-2068021.html) (170g): Made of 100% recycled polyester stretch ripstop (the same fabric as Patagonia Terrebonne Joggers), these pants are incredibly light and breathable. They offer a good range of motion despite being only slightly stretchy. These are my go-to pants for Hong Kong summers and hiking. Compared to the Patagonia Terrebonne Joggers, they look less outdoorsy and feature a zip fly and internal drawstring. They're also much more affordable, especially during sales. For more options, check out this [Summer Wear DataSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pA8ym5gRNhmfyDUdBcTGv14gtyV25XMLpdrpZb0mdxY/edit?gid=1027755927#gid=1027755927) created by DeputySean.

[Western Rise Evolution Pant 2.0](https://westernrise.com/products/evolution-pant-classic-dune?variant=42139842969783): A stylish option suitable for business casual settings, though they may be too warm for Hong Kong summers.

Outdoor Research Men's Ferrosi Pant: Very stretchy and breathable, but not as light as the Trail Sender Pant.

**Uniqlo Airism Boxer** (20g): Lightweight, breathable, and affordable underwear.

**Inov-8 Trailfly G270** (Size 9.5): A versatile and durable trail running shoe. I previously used the Altra Lone Peak 5, which was comfortable but less durable than the Trailfly G270.

Lems Drifter: Received as a gift, these shoes are very comfortable but not as breathable as I'd hoped. I use them during Hong Kong winters.

**Luna Venado 2.0 Sandals** (255g, Size 8.5): These minimalist sandals are my daily drivers. They're comfortable for walking, work as camp shoes, and double as pool shoes when needed. They become very comfortable once you adjust the straps properly.

## Miscellaneous

**Tiger MMZ K-501 Water Bottle** (190g, 0.5L): Purchased at Bic Camera in Japan, this is likely the lightest 0.5L insulated bottle available. It's the perfect size for everyday carry and short hikes. After two years of use, it's still performing excellently.

[Borah Gear 7x11" stuff sack](https://www.borahgear.com/stuffsacks.html) (5g): Used for storing the Nitecore NB10000, NU20, and USB cable.

[Sea to Summit laundry soap flakes](https://amazon.com/Sea-Summit-Travel-Pocket-Laundry/dp/B002BO60JI): Useful for washing clothes in hostels without laundry facilities. TSA carry-on compliant, though it doesn't lather much, and I'm unsure of its effectiveness.

[FIZAN Compact Trekking Poles](https://www.outdoorline.sk/en/trekking-poles/fizan-compact-trekking-poles?search_query=Fizan+compact&results=6#/20-color-red) (158g \* 2): Affordable and lightweight trekking poles.

Sea to Summit Head net (21g): I haven't found this particularly useful in Hong Kong.

Oral-B iO4: Used for 2 years, very reliable. Purchase from US Amazon during Black Friday sales. Swap the charger to a 220V one from Taobao (the standard voltage in HK) for perfect functionality.

Panasonic ES-LV67: Used for over 4 years, very reliable electric shaver.

[Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Sack](https://seatosummit.com/product/ultra-sil-dry-sack/): Used for packing clothes during travel or storing wet swimwear after swimming.

## Backpacking Gear

### Bags

**LiteAF Ultra200 Curve 40L**: For longer trips and backpacking adventures, this ultralight pack is my choice. The Ultra200 fabric offers an excellent strength-to-weight ratio, and the frame provides comfort for heavier loads.

Nylofume Pack Liner Bags: From LiteSmith, weighing 25.9g.

### Sleep System

**Enlightened Equipment Enigma 30°F** (-1°C) Quilt: This 850 fill power down quilt hits the sweet spot for warmth, weight, and versatility. The 10D fabric keeps it ultralight without sacrificing durability.

**Sea to Summit Aeros Premium Pillow** (113g / 4oz): A good night's sleep is worth the extra weight. This inflatable pillow packs tiny but provides excellent comfort and support.

Sea to Summit UltralightAir Insulated Pad (479g): With an R-value of 3.1, this pad offers a good balance of warmth and comfort. Unfortunately, I've developed a slow leak that I haven't been able to locate yet.

Nemo Switchback (Cut to half-length, ~210g): At 91.5cm for 7 pieces, this pad provides insulation where you need it most. You don't need it above the neck (the pillow is enough) or below the thighs (your backpack or a seating pad can be used). Best of all, you never have to worry about air leaks.

[**Gossamer Gear Thinlight foam pad - 1/8"**](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/thinlight-foam-pad?variant=30497164620) (76g): Measures 19 x 59 inches.

### Shelter

**Durston X-Mid 2P**: An incredibly well-designed lightweight trekking pole tent. It offers excellent storm protection and livable space for its weight.

### Cooking System

**Evernew Titanium 1300ml Pot** (130g): The wide, shallow design is perfect for alcohol stoves and great for melting snow. The thin titanium walls conduct heat efficiently.

**Trail Designs Sidewinder Ti-Tri with Kojin Stove**: A versatile, ultralight cooking system that works with multiple fuel types. The Kojin alcohol stove is particularly efficient and user-friendly. I previously used a Trangia stove (14.3cm width \* 6.5cm height) but it broke.

[Sea to Summit Alpha Light Long Spoon](https://www.rei.com/product/782241/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-spoon-long) (12g) and [Spork](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-long-handled-spork_10225937) (12g): Lightweight, durable utensils that reach the bottom of freeze-dried meal bags without getting your hands messy.

**Bic MiniLighter** (12g): Can be purchased from 7-11.
