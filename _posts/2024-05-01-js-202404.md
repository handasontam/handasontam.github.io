> Two robots, Aaron and Erin, have made it to this year’s final! Initially they are situated at the center of a unit circle. A flag is placed somewhere inside the circle, at a location chosen uniformly at random. Once the flag is placed, Aaron is able to deduce its distance to the flag, and Erin is only able to deduce its direction to the flag. (Equivalently: if (r, θ) are the polar coordinates of the flag’s location, Aaron is told r and Erin is told θ.) 
> 
> Both robots are allowed to make a single move after the flag is placed, if they wish. Any move they make is without knowledge of what the other robot is doing. (And they may not move outside the circle.)
> 
> Whichever robot is closer to the flag after these moves captures the flag and is declared the winner!
> 
> During the preliminaries it was discovered that Erin is programmed to play a fixed distance along the detected angle θ. Assuming otherwise optimal play by both robots, can you determine the probability that Aaron will win? (Please express your answer to 10 decimal places.)


## Solution Approach
To solve this puzzle, we'll follow these steps:
1. Determine Aaron's optimal strategy.
2. Calculate Aaron's win probability as a function of Erin's fixed distance.
3. Find Erin's optimal fixed distance.
4. Compute the final win probabilities.

### 1. Aaron's Optimal Strategy

Let's define some variables:
- $$r_E$$: Erin's fixed movement distance
- $$r$$: The actual distance to the flag (known to Aaron)
- $$r_A(r)$$: Aaron's chosen movement distance
- $$\theta_A(r)$$: Aaron's chosen movement angle

Since Aaron doesn't know the flag's direction, his best strategy is to choose $$\theta_A(r)$$ uniformly at random: $$\theta_A(r) \sim U(0, 2\pi)$$.

To win, Aaron must end up closer to the flag than Erin. This occurs when his final position falls within a circle centered at the flag's location, with radius $$\lvert r_E - r\rvert$$.

To maximize his chances, Aaron should choose $$r_A$$ such that it forms a right triangle with $$\lvert r_E-r\rvert$$ and $$r$$:

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/js-202404-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true width="40%" %}

Why? Imagine $$r_A$$ rotates around the origin, comparing to other choice of $$r_A$$, this choice ensures the locus enters this region earliest and leaving it latest, and thus maximizing the probability Aaron stays in this region.
Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have: $$r_A(r) = \sqrt{r^2-\lvert r_E-r\rvert^2} = \sqrt{r_E(2r-r_E)}$$ when $$r^2 \geq \lvert r_E-r\rvert^2$$, or equivalently, $$r \geq \frac{r_E}{2}$$. What if $$r < \frac{r_E}{2}$$? In this case, Aaron gurantees a win by staying at the center (i.e. choosing $$r_A = 0$$), as his distance to the flag ($$r$$) will always be less than Erin's ($$\lvert r_E-r\rvert$$).
Now, we have successfully derived the best response of Aaron:

$$r_A(r) = \begin{cases} 
\sqrt{r_E(2r-r_E)} & \text{if } r \geq \frac{r_E}{2} \\
0 & \text{if } r < \frac{r_E}{2}
\end{cases}$$

### 2. Aaron's Win Probability

Given Aaron's optimal strategy, we can express his win probability as a function of $$r_E$$:

$$
\begin{align}
P(\text{Aaron wins}) &= \int_{r_E/2}^{1} \frac{2r}{π} \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{r_E (2r - r_E)}}{r}\right) dr + \int_{0}^{r_E/2} 2r dr \\
&= \int_{r_E/2}^{1} \frac{2r}{π} \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{r_E (2r - r_E)}}{r}\right) dr + \frac{r_E^2}{4}
\end{align}
$$

### 3. Erin's Optimal Strategy
Knowing Aaron's win probability, Erin would choose $$r_E$$ to minimize Aaron's win probability.
At this point, we can use numerical solver to minimize the above function with respect to $$r_E$$. 
(Side note: I spend a lot of time trying to solve this analytically but failed, and then I realized 
that closed form solution is not necessary. I should have just used numerical solver from the 
beginning...)
Erin's goal is to minimize Aaron's win probability by choosing the optimal $$r_E$$. While an analytical solution proves challenging, we can use numerical methods to find the minimum.

### 4. Numerical Solution
Using Python with SciPy for numerical integration and optimization:
```python
import scipy.integrate as integrate
import scipy.special as special
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
import numpy as np

def f(r_1):
    return integrate.quad(lambda r: 2*r/np.pi * np.arccos(np.sqrt(r_1 * (2 * r - r_1))/r), r_1/2, 1, 
    epsabs=1e-30, epsrel=1e-30)[0] + (r_1**2)/4

res = minimize_scalar(f, bounds=(0,1), method='bounded')


print("Erwin should choose r_1 = ", res.x)  # 0.5013067075684123
print(f"The best response of Aaron is to choose r_2 = 0 if r < (r_1)/2 and choose r_2 = sqrt(r_1 * (2r - r_1)) if (r_1)/2 < r < 1")
print("Erwin's win probability is ", 1-res.fun)  # 0.8338135135259306
print("Aaron's win probability is ", res.fun)  # 0.16618648647406942
```

The result shows that at equilibrium, Erin would chooses a fixed $$r_E \approx 0.5013$$, Aaron will 
choose 

$$r_A = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } r < \frac{r_E}{2} \\
\sqrt{r_E (2r - r_E)} & \text{if } \frac{r_E}{2} < r < 1
\end{cases}$$

And the probability that Aaron wins is $$\approx 0.1662$$.
